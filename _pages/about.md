# About

<!-- <img src="assets/000005850022.jpg"/> -->

I am a product and service designer with a passion for solving complex problems for users often left behind. In my spare time, I enjoy being in the ocean, various endeavours to become bilingual, and making [[strange music with overly complicated systems]].

## Experience
Currently taking part in the NSW Government graduate program as a digital graduate, my learning has been wide-ranging and insightful.

Prior to now, I taught Interactive Product Design at the University of Sydney, as well as designed educational material for the not-for-profit education startup Consent Labs.
