I am a product and service designer with a passion for solving complex problems for users often left behind. In my spare time, I enjoy being in the ocean, various endeavours to become bilingual, playing with [[Ziggy]] and making strange music with overly complicated systems.

## Experience
Currently taking part in the NSW Government graduate program as a digital graduate, my learning has been wide-ranging and insightful.

Prior to now, I have:
- taught Interactive Product Design at the University of Sydney,
- taught Qualitative Research at the University of Sydney
- designed educational material for the not-for-profit education startup Consent Labs
- lead and co-directed an out of hours school care (*great fun, terribly exhausting*)
