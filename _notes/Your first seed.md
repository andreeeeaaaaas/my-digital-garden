## What on earth is a digital space?

I like to think of this space as a reclamation of my own plot on the internet. The idea draws from the popular notion of a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history); an everexpanding plexus of personal thoughts intertwined with related bits of information.

If you would like to recreate something similar, you can achieve similar results using the free, open-source template from Maxime Vaillancourt [available on GitHub here](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template).
